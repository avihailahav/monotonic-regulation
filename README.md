# monotonic-regulation

1. regulation_conditions: The 2D array stores the 18 rows of conditions from the table.
2. is_monotonic: A placeholder function to check if a condition is monotonic. You need to replace the logic inside this function according to your specific requirements.
3. find_monotonic_conditions: Iterates over all conditions, checks if they are monotonic using is_monotonic, and stores the monotonic conditions in the result array.
4. main: Finds all monotonic conditions and prints them.
You'll need to fill in the actual conditions and the logic for checking monotonicity in the is_monotonic function.

# HOW TO RUN
Compile the C Code
In the terminal, navigate to the directory where the C file is saved. Then compile the code using GCC:

gcc monotonic_conditions.c -o monotonic_conditions

This command compiles monotonic_conditions.c into an executable named monotonic_conditions.

Run the Program
Execute the compiled program:

./monotonic_conditions

This will run the program and output the monotonic regulation conditions based on the logic you've implemented.
