# monotonic-regulation

regulation_conditions: The 2D array stores the 18 rows of conditions from the table.
is_monotonic: A placeholder function to check if a condition is monotonic. You need to replace the logic inside this function according to your specific requirements.
find_monotonic_conditions: Iterates over all conditions, checks if they are monotonic using is_monotonic, and stores the monotonic conditions in the result array.
main: Finds all monotonic conditions and prints them.
You'll need to fill in the actual conditions and the logic for checking monotonicity in the is_monotonic function.
